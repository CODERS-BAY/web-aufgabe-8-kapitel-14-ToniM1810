            Dubrovnik is one of the world’s most magnificent walled cities, overlooking the calm 
            blue Adriatic. Once the capital of the mighty sea-faring Republic of Ragusa (1358-1808), 
            it's now Croatia’s most upmarket destination. Historically, this diminutive republic was 
            sophisticated, refined and cultured. Today, the pedestrian-only Old Town – packed with 
            aristocratic palazzi and elegant Baroque churches, contained within sturdy medieval 
            fortifications – draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually, including glamorous 
            names such as Beyoncé, Roman Abramovich, Sir Roger Moore and Naomi Campbell. Beyond the 
            walls, attractions include wine bars, classy seafood restaurants and five-star hotels.

            And then there's the glorious rock-and-pebble coast, with beaches, scuba diving and sea 
            kayaking. Some of the best beaches lie on Lapad peninsular, two miles (three kilometres) 
            west of town; or you might try tiny Lokrum islet, with its botanical garden (you can get 
            taxi-boats from the old town harbour); or the pine-scented Elaphiti islands (ferry from 
            Gruž port).

        The oldest part of Dubrovnik, the Old Town is located east of Lapad at the bottom of Srd hill. 
        It has well preserved cultural and historical heritage and is therefore inscribed on the 
        UNESCO’s List of World Heritage Sites. Old Town’s street and squares are stone-paved while the 
        architecture consists of elegant terraced houses, monasteries, churches, palaces, galleries and 
        museums. 
        Except for its historical heritage, Dubrovnik also offers good holiday opportunity in terms of 
        sea, sun, nightlife, restaurants and taverns with various specialities of local as well as 
        international cuisine. Nowadays, Dubrovnik has a population of about 44 thousand.

        History
        <br>
        <br>
        The city was founded about 614 as Rausa, or Ragusium, by Roman refugees fleeing the Slav and 
        Avar sack of Epidaurus, just to the southeast. A colony of Slavs soon joined the Romans there, 
        and from an early date the city formed a link between two great civilizations. After the fall 
        of Rome, Dubrovnik was ruled by the Byzantine Empire. From the 9th to the 12th century Dubrovnik
        defended itself against foreign powers, and in the period 1205 to 1358 it acknowledged Venetian 
        suzerainty, though it retained much of its independence. The city-republic was liberal in character, 
        affording asylum to refugees of all nations—one of them, according to legend, was King Richard I 
        (the Lionheart) of England, who landed on the offshore island of Lokrum in 1192 on his return from
        the Crusades—and abolishing the slave trade in 1418, and by means of treaty and tribute it enlarged
        its territory along the Dalmatian coast. In 1272 the city received a statute that incorporated 
        Roman and local practices. Situated at the seaward end of overland trade routes to Byzantium and
        the Danube region, it became a great mercantile power. Ragusan land trade flourished throughout
        the Balkans.    
        <br>
        In 1420, when Dalmatia was sold to Venice, Dubrovnik remained a free city in all but name. 
        For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful 
        maneuvering between East and West. A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Dubrovnik’s 
        liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire 
        and Europe. In the 16th century Dubrovnik traded with India and the Americas (the republic 
        was among the first to recognize the independence of the United States in the late 18th century), 
        and the city contributed ships to Spain in 1588 for the Armada’s abortive invasion of England.
        A great flourishing of art and literature, in the 15th–17th century, earned it the title of
         “the South Slav Athens.” For the first time in the history of the South Slavs, the 
         language of the people was introduced into literature. The city’s literary history,
          however, never compared to its maritime and mercantile achievements.
